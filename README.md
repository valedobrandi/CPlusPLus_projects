# C++ Projects

## Overview
This repository serves as a collection of C++ projects aimed at learning and experimenting with the language. It includes implementations of classical algorithms and exercises in object-oriented programming.

## Projects
- `cpp_00` - `cpp_09`: A series of exercises focusing on core C++ programming concepts, object-oriented techniques, and algorithm development. The final project, `cpp_09`, includes data structures and advanced algorithms as a culmination of the prior exercises.
- `webserv`: A standalone implementation of an HTTP web server inspired by Nginx, built entirely from scratch.

## How to Run
Each project can be compiled and run using `make`. Simply navigate to the directory of the desired project and execute:
```sh
make
```

## Noteworthy Features
- The `cpp_09` project includes advanced algorithms and data structures, which demonstrate proficiency in C++ programming.
- The `webserv` project showcases a deeper understanding of system-level programming through the creation of an HTTP web server.

## Future Plans
- Continue to enhance the `webserv` project, adding more features and improving its performance.
- Expand the repository with additional projects to explore other facets of C++ programming.
